# Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines Oxboxtra inside jokes mod

A mod with that was inspired by wonderful people at the YouTube channels [Outside Xbox](https://www.youtube.com/user/outsidexbox) / [Outside Xtra](https://www.youtube.com/user/outsidextra) mainly the videos below.

I am not affliated with Outside Xbox or Outside Xtra. I just love their videos. If you like this mod, go support them.
