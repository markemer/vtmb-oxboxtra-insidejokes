# Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines Oxboxtra inside jokes mod

## The Story

A mod with that was inspired by wonderful people at the YouTube channels [Outside Xbox](https://www.youtube.com/user/outsidexbox) / [Outside Xtra](https://www.youtube.com/user/outsidextra) mainly the videos below. In the first video, the genius statistic of "Sexterity" was invented and a stupid idea was born.

_I am not affliated with Outside Xbox or Outside Xtra. I just love their videos. If you like this mod, go support them. They have a patreon at https://www.patreon.com/oxclub, or you know, just watch all of their videos in order._

## Installing

You'll need VTM: Bloodlines with the latest unofficial patch installed. If you replace the the file `Unofficial_Patch/vdata/system/feats.txt` with the one in this package it should replace Seduction on the Character Sheet with "Sexterity" which is _totally a thing_. 

I haven't tried it with all the mods, but any that change `feats.txt` could be impacted. I plan on making this more robust in the future, but this will work now.
